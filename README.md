# Human_Activity_Recognition


Human activity recognition (HAR) plays a crucial role in people’s daily life for its competence in learning profound high-level knowledge about human activity. 

Two main types of HAR:  
- Video-based HAR: analyzes videos or images containing human motions from the camera 
- Sensor-based HAR: motion from sensors – accelerometer, gyroscope, Bluetooth, sound sensors, etc. 


HAR using wearable devices has been actively investigated for a wide range of applications:
- Healthcare:  fall detection systems, elderly monitoring, and disease prevention
- Sports training: energy expenditure, skill assessment
- Smart assistive technologies, i.e. smart homes: aid people with cognitive and physical limitations, etc.

Our objectives in this project: 
- Focus on Sensor-based HAR: using accelerometer data to classify 6 activities

- Apply different types of  Deep Learning technique to discover which method performs the best in term of: Generalization, Accuracy, f1-score, precision, recall, time given minimal  data- preprocessing & transformation
